Unlike existing projects, this is an AV1 decoder implemented entirely from scratch in Rust. Note, however, that this is an experimental project, not intended for production use, so there is no particular focus on performance, and only basic features will be implemented.

This project is mainly for learning and understanding the features of AV1 encoding and video encoding.
